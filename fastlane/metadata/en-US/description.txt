Secret Squirrel is a code name generator that is easy to use, customisable and designed to be flexible. Once a project name has been selected you can share it with friends or colleagues using SMS, iMessage or email.

Features planned for future versions include themes that determine the types of codes generated and user maintained word categories.

Never feel intimidated by project naming again! Let Secret Squirrel decide on the little things so you can focus on the big picture.
