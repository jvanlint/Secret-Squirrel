Thanks to the small community of people who have downloaded this app. Welcome to the new improved release notes for v.1.0.5!
• Small improvements to code name themes interface and experience.

*** NEW ***
• Nothing for the moment. But your ideas are welcome!

*** IMPROVEMENTS ***
• The theme selection screen will now highlight a theme if it was selected. You should see a red(ish) background on any theme that matches the currently selected word categories.

*** FIXED ***
• Minor bug fixes.

This app is being used by me as a test bed for new concepts and learning in Swift. Expect to see it updated regularly.
