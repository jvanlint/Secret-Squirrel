Thanks to the small community of people who have downloaded this app! Welcome to the new improved release notes for v.1.0.5
• Small improvements to code name themes interface and experience.

*** NEW ***
• Categories can now be modified. View all the words in a category, add your own words or swipe to delete those you don't like.

*** IMPROVEMENTS ***
• The theme selection screen will now highlight a theme if it was selected. You should see a red(ish) background on any theme that matches the currently selected word categories.
• Animation comes to Secret Squirrel. Code name generator nows animates text and smoothly changes background colors. Little animation tweaks made throughout app. See if you can spot them.

*** FIXED ***
• Minor bug fixes.

This app is being used by me as a way for learning and testing new concepts in the Swift language. Expect to see it updated regularly.
